# Frontend Design Workflow

This workflow guides the process of creating distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces, leveraging the `frontend-design` skill for aesthetic guidelines.

## 1. Design Thinking Phase

**Before coding**, you MUST establish the direction.

1. **Consult the Skill**: Read `.agent/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` for inspiration and strict guidelines.
2. **Define the Vision**:
   - Ask clarifying questions if the user's intent is vague.
   - Propose a specific aesthetic direction (Tone, Typography, Color Palette).
   - Get user buy-in on the "Vibe".

## 2. Implementation Phase

1. **Scaffold**: Set up the file structure and basic components.
2. **Style**: Apply the chosen aesthetic direction using the guidelines from the Skill.
   - *Typography*: Import unique fonts.
   - *Theme*: Define CSS variables for the color palette.
   - *Layout*: Implement the spatial composition.
3. **Refine**: Add "Juice" (Motion, Micro-interactions, Visual Details).

## 3. Verification Phase

1. **Responsive Check**: Verify on mobile (375px) and desktop sizes.
2. **Accessibility Check**: Ensure contrast and keyboard navigation.
3. **Console Check**: Ensure no errors.

## When to use this workflow
